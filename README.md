# Project Idea after Discussion

1. Combining Maps with Food-Pickup

  - What is the name of our app?

    - Hungry?
    - Fimer (food timer?)

  - User Stories

    - As a **user**, I should be able to place an order because I want to eat
    - As a **restaurant**, I should be able to accept an order because I need to make money
    - As a **restaurant**, I need to be able to let the **user** know the order is accepted
    - As a **restaurant**, I need to be able to give the **user** an estimated time to complete their meal
    - As a **user**, I need to know when my food is ready for pickup because I want to eat
    - As a **restaurant**, I need to be able to send a user an SMS because their food is ready for pickup

  - Focus on the food Functionality

  - if we have time after we can implement the favourite maps feature as well

  - [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS

  - [Ritual](https://www.ritual.co/) for inspiration

  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for hosting

  - [LeafLets.js](http://leafletjs.com/)

  - [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

  - Yelp APIs for restaurant locations?
